Project KIWI

The purpose of this project is to design an app that uses API's in order to copy music playlists cross-platform.

Example use Case:
- You and a friend want to share music playlist, but unfortunately you use 
  spotify and they use Apple Music. You can open this app login into whichever
  platform you use and paste the link of the apple music playlist or browse for it.
  You can then copy the playlist onto your music account (Spotify)

Additional features:
- Rate my music Taste
- Percent similarity of music Taste
